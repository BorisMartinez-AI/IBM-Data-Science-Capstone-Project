The methodology used in the project follows the Data Science framework described in the IBM Data Science Certificate Program which encompasses the following phases: ​

### 1. Data collection through SpaceX Rest API and Web Scrapping with BeautifulSoup​
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, Pandas and Matplotlib​
### 3. Interactive Data Visualization and Analytics using Dashboards with Plotly Dash and maps with Folium​
