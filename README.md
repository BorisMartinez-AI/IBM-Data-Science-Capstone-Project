# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Prediction model to determine if stage-1 of Space X Falcon 9 rocket will return to earth and land successfully so that it can be re-used in further missions.

The methodology used in the project follows the Data Science framework described in the IBM Data Science Certificate Program which encompasses the following phases: ​

Data collection through SpaceX Rest API and Web Scrapping with BeautifulSoup​

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, Pandas and Matplotlib​

Interactive Data Visualization and Analytics using Dashboards with Plotly Dash and maps with Folium​

Machine learning model construction using logistic regression, Support Vector Machine and Tree classifiers. ​

Model evaluation through confusion matrix which encompasses indicators like precision, recall and F1-accuracy score.​

Results Presentation and final conclusion and implications​
